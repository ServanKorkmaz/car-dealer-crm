You are building the **Cars & Inventory Management** module for ForhandlerPRO, a next-generation Dealer Management System (DMS). 
Forget what’s coded before, you can redesign and improve everything to be the best in class. 

🎯 Objective:
Create a **world-class, professional, and beautiful Cars & Inventory Management module** with the following features:  

### 🔑 Core Features
1. **Car listing page (inventory overview)**  
   - Grid/table layout with professional UI (Tailwind + shadcn/ui).  
   - Each car card should show: image, make/model, year, mileage, price, VAT-status, EU-control, status (available/sold/reserved).  
   - Filters at the top (make, year, price range, fuel type, gearbox, status).  
   - Powerful **search bar** with instant filtering (fuzzy search on reg.nr, VIN, make/model).  
   - Sortable columns (price, year, mileage, added date).  
   - Responsive design: works perfectly on mobile (important for salespeople).  

2. **Add new car flow**  
   - Big, clean “+ Add Car” button.  
   - When entering reg.nr, automatically fetch: brand, model, year, EU-control dates, technical data (from Statens Vegvesen API or mocked service).  
   - Pre-fill the fields but allow manual editing.  
   - Upload multiple images (drag & drop). Show preview gallery.  
   - Option to mark car as **VAT-included, VAT-exempt, or margin scheme** (important for dealers).  

3. **Car detail page**  
   - Clean page with all info about the car (images carousel, full technical data, history).  
   - Buttons for: Edit, Duplicate, Mark as Sold, Publish to Finn.no (future integration), Delete.  
   - Show “Activity log” (when was it added, edited, sold).  

4. **Status management**  
   - Cars should have clear statuses: *Available, Reserved, Sold*.  
   - Changing status should update across system instantly.  
   - Sold cars should remain in history but not in active stock.  

5. **Smart UX details**  
   - Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., press “A” = add new car).  
   - Bulk actions (select multiple cars → mark as sold, delete, export).  
   - Subtle animations with Framer Motion (smooth transitions, hover effects).  
   - Toast notifications for every action (e.g., “Car successfully added”).  

### 🌟 Advanced Enhancements (to outcompete competitors)
- **AI-powered price suggestion** (basic mock now, real later) → suggest fair market price when adding car.  
- **Export inventory as PDF/Excel** (for advertising or accounting).  
- **Dark/light mode toggle** (modern UI touch).  
- **Activity feed** showing “Latest changes” across cars (who added, edited, sold).  

### 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines
- Professional look & feel → clean, minimal, modern.  
- Rounded cards, soft shadows, plenty of white space.  
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui components everywhere.  
- Image-heavy design (cars sell visually).  
- Mobile-first responsive layout.
