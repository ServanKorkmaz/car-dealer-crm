UX Guidelines:

Minimize cognitive load with clear visual hierarchy
Use progressive disclosure (tabs organize complex information)
Provide immediate feedback for all interactions
Make common actions easily accessible
Use familiar patterns from modern web applications

Norwegian Labels:

Use Norwegian text for all labels and buttons
"Rediger" (Edit), "Lagre" (Save), "Avbryt" (Cancel)
"Oversikt", "Detaljer", "Prising", "Markedsføring" for tabs
"Kilometerstand", "Drivstoff", "Årsmodell", etc.

Create a polished, production-ready component that feels like a premium SaaS application. Focus on smooth interactions, professional aesthetics, and intuitive user experience.
